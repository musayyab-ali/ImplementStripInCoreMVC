# ImplementStripInCoreMVC
 Here is a more detailed description of each step in the process of implementing Stripe in a .NET Core MVC application:

 Install the Stripe SDK:

Begin by installing the Stripe .NET library using a package manager like NuGet. You can do this by executing the following command in the Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI:
dotnet add package Stripe

Configure Stripe:

Configure your Stripe API keys in the appsettings.json file or environment variables. This is essential for authenticating your application with the Stripe API. Here is an example configuration in the appsettings.json file:
{
  "StripeOptions": {
    "SecretKey": "your_stripe_secret_key"
  }
}

Set up Models:

Create appropriate models that can handle payment data and any other relevant information needed for the payment process. These models can include PaymentIntent, StripePaymentViewModel, or any other models necessary for your application's specific requirements.
Implement Controller Actions:

Create controller actions responsible for processing payments, handling success and cancellation scenarios, and managing other related functionalities. These actions should interact with the Stripe SDK and handle the necessary logic for different payment outcomes.
Configure Views:

Set up the corresponding views to work with the controller actions. These views should include payment forms, success messages, error messages, and any other relevant UI components required for the payment process.
